# FEM - Finite Element Method 
### Project Description
The project, solves Kirchhoff's Fourier . It is specifically designed for 2D rectangular elements, allowing the computation of temperature distribution at nodes under specified conditions.
The calculations are performed iteratively over time, and the results are displayed as the minimum and maximum temperature values for each time step.
### Technologies
**Programming language**: C++
### Features
- Computes temperature distribution at nodes based on given conditions.
- Solves the equation iteratively over time.
- Displays results as minimum and maximum temperature values at each time step.
- Supports input data from .txt files.
### Usage Instructions
- Prepare an input .txt file containing the appropriate data for the 
[𝐻], [𝐶] matrices, and the {𝑃} vector.
- Run the program in a terminal/IDE with access to a C++ compiler.
- The program will display the results, including the minimum and maximum temperatures for each time iteration.
